 I need to create a trending hard drive report.  
 It should poll the status of the hard drive space remaining multiple times.  
 Eachtime he remaining should be saved per volume.  
 At some point it should calculate the rate at which the freespace is being used.  
 Then it should figure out how long the drive has until it's full.  
 Only send email if it meets a certain time frame for capacity.
